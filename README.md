# Super Simple PDF Merge tool

![Super Simple PDF Merge](https://github.com/[username]/[reponame]/blob/[branch]/image.png?raw=true)

Written in C# with the iTextSharp library, this simple WPF app combines multiple PDFs into one. 

That's all it does.

You can add files, remove them, change the order they'll be combined, give the output file a name and a path where it will be installed.

If you just want to use the tool, download the .zip file and run setup.exe to install on your computer.

Enjoy!
