# Super Simple PDF Merge tool

Written in C# with the iTextSharp library, this simple WPF app combines multiple PDFs into one. 

That's all it does.

You can add files, remove them, change the order they'll be combined, give the output file a name and a path where it will be installed.

You can download the files and run setup.exe in the InstallableFiles folder to install the program to your PC.

Enjoy!
